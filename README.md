# Abstract
Investing in the stock market can be a profitable but also a risky endeavor. Keeping track of stock prices and performance can be time-consuming and overwhelming, especially for novice investors. The purpose of this project is to create a stock tracker that allows users to easily monitor and track the performance of their investments. The stock tracker will be developed using java script programming language and various APIs, including the finhub.i API for historical data. The stock tracker will provide users with a user-friendly interface for visualizing data and making informed investment decisions. 

# Introduction
 The stock market is a dynamic and constantly changing environment. Keeping track of stock prices and performance can be a daunting task, especially for novice investors. A stock tracker can be a useful tool for anyone interested in monitoring and tracking their investments. The purpose of this project is to create a stock tracker that allows users to easily monitor and track the performance of their investments. The stock tracker will provide real-time stock data, historical data, and visualizations to help users make informed decisions about their investments.
 
# Aim of the project:
The aim of this project is to create a stock tracker that allows users to easily monitor and track the performance of their investments. The stock tracker will provide historical data, and visualizations to help users make informed decisions about their investments.

# Design & Implementation:
The stock tracker will be developed using java script programming language and various libraries, including react js and rechart.js. The finhub.ie API will be used to retrieve historical stock data, including the current stock price, daily high and low, as well as other key metrics. The finhub.i API will be used to retrieve historical stock data, which will allow users to view the stock performance over time. The first step in the development process will be to create a user interface using postcss. The interface will allow users to enter the ticker symbols of the stocks they wish to track, and will display the current stock price and other relevant data in historical-time. The interface will also include visualizations of the stock performance, including graphs and charts. Next, we will integrate the finhub.ie API to retrieve historical-time stock data for the entered ticker symbols. This data will be updated in historical-time to ensure that users have access to the latest information. The finhub.i API will be used to retrieve historical stock data, which will allow users to view the stock performance over time. This data will be used to generate historical performance graphs and charts. Users will be able to choose the time period they wish to view and the frequency of the data points.

#  Innovation:
The stock tracker project leverages various APIs to provide  historical stock data to users. The project also includes user-friendly visualizations, making it easy for users to monitor and track the performance of their investments.

# Technical Complexity:
The stock tracker project requires the integration of multiple APIs and libraries, as well as the implementation of real-time data retrieval and user-friendly visualizations. The project also requires error handling and testing to ensure its stability and usability. We have used google cloud for deployment.

# Social Impact:
The stock tracker project provides a valuable tool for novice and experienced investors alike. By allowing users to easily monitor and track the performance of their investments, the project can help users make informed investment decisions and potentially increase their financial literacy.

# Commercial Viability:
 The stock tracker project has commercial viability as it provides a valuable tool for investors. The project can be extended to include additional features, such as alerts and notifications, which could make it more appealing to potential customers.
 
 #  Conclusion:
 In conclusion, the stock tracker project is a valuable tool for anyone interested in monitoring and tracking their investments. By leveraging APIs and various java script libraries, we are able to create a user-friendly interface and provide real-time data and visualizations to help users make informed decisions.
